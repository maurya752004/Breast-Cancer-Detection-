# Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

Breast cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases affecting women worldwide.  
If it is not identified at an early stage, it can lead to serious complications and even death.

According to global studies, nearly **12% of women worldwide are affected by breast cancer**, and the number continues to increase every year. Early detection plays a crucial role in increasing survival rates.

## 🧠 Why Machine Learning?

In real-world medical scenarios, doctors may not always be able to identify breast cancer accurately for every patient due to limitations such as time, human error, or complexity of data.

This is where **Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientists** come into the picture.  
Using mathematics, statistics, and computational power, machine learning models can assist in:

- Early detection of breast cancer  
- Reducing human error  
- Improving diagnostic accuracy  
- Supporting medical decision-making
